There is no documentation.
Do you think if something goes wrong, people will run to some document to fix it? I'm the one who built this infrastructure from the ground up. Every line of code, every configuration, every piece of architecture, do you think this all runs because of a piece of paper? It runs because of me. You clearly don’t know who you’re talking to so let me clue you in. You don’t need any documentation team.
I am the DOCUMENTATION. 
When something goes wrong, they don’t go to a document, they run to me.
I AM THE ONE WHO CODE.
