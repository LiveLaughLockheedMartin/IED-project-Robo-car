# 🤖 Self-Driving Trash-Picking Robot Car

An autonomous robot car designed to detect, approach, and pick up obstacles using ultrasonic and IR sensors.  
Equipped with a servo-powered claw, the bot identifies objects, avoids collisions, and performs automated trash collection tasks.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This robot car combines **ultrasonic distance sensing**, **IR color/object detection**, and **servo-based actuation** to navigate its environment autonomously.  
It can detect nearby obstacles, determine their color (e.g., green or purple), and activate a claw mechanism to pick them up.

The system also supports **laser signal overrides**, allowing users to interrupt current actions and trigger specific operations remotely.

## 🧠 Features

- 🔊 **Dual Ultrasonic Sensors** (at 10 o’clock and 2 o’clock) for obstacle detection  
- 👁️ **IR Sensor** (at 12 o’clock) for color and object identification  
- 🦾 **Servo-Controlled Claw** for picking up detected objects  
- 🛞 **Bidirectional Motor Control** for movement and steering  
- 🧩 **Laser Signal Interrupt System** to override current operations  
- 🧱 **Modular Arduino C++ Codebase** for easy testing and expansion

## 💻 Code Structure

### `autonomous_mode.ino`
Handles:
- Ultrasonic distance measurement  
- IR color detection  
- Obstacle avoidance  
- Claw control for trash pickup  

### `laser_override_mode.ino`
Handles:
- Detection of laser hits via photodiodes  
- Interrupting the current routine  
- Executing pre-defined response actions

## 🔬 Working Principle

1. The robot continuously reads distances from both ultrasonic sensors.  
2. If an obstacle is detected within the threshold range (typically < 30 cm), the robot:
   - Stops  
   - Moves backward slightly  
   - Turns away from the obstacle  
   - Moves forward again  
3. If the IR sensor detects an object of a specific color (green or purple), the servo claw activates to pick it up.  
4. If a laser signal is detected, the robot stops all operations and executes the override routine.
